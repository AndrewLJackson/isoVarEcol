# isoVarEcol

This is a work-in-progress repository which will ultimately take the form of a downloadable R package to simulate and analyse the relationship between diet variation and variation in stable isotope tracers while also modelling the effects of environmental variation. The repository has the basic structure of a R package, with functions in the folder `R/` and models and examples in the folder `vignettes\`.

## Things to do

- complete the Roxygen help sections for each function
- add code and examples for within-individual variation based on our current Python code held elsewhere
- edit for consistency with the forth-coming associated paper
